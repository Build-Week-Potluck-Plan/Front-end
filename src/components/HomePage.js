            <p>The word pot-luck appears in the 16th century English work of Thomas Nashe, and used to mean "food provided for an unexpected or uninvited guest, the luck of the pot." The modern execution of a "communal meal, where guests bring their own food," most likely originated in the 1930s during the Depression.</p>
